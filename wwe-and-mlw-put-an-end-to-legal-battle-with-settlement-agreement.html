MLW claimed that Vince McMahon’s company used its influence to prevent MLW from securing a television deal with a major network, impeding their growth and violating antitrust laws. Now it appears MLW and WWE finally ended their legal battle with a settlement.</p><p>The lawsuit also alleged that Triple H contacted Madison Square Garden to encourage them to cancel an event hosted by New Japan Pro-Wrestling and Ring of Honor</p><p>WWE previously sought to have the lawsuit dismissed, as they argued that MLW did not present a valid claim. However, the court ruled against WWE’s motion, allowing MLW’s lawsuit to proceed. MLW, in their quest for justice,&nbsp;<a href=#>requested 22 years of data from WWE</a>&nbsp;as part of their lawsuit.</p><p>WWE presented an&nbsp;<a href=#>extensive list of potential defenses against MLW</a>. Brandon Thurston of WrestleNomics took to Twitter and noted after obtaining court documents that the two sides are in the process of finalizing a settlement in the suit.</p><p>“The Parties are in the process of completing the final settlement documents and expect to file the appropriate dismissal papers within the next thirty (30) days.”</p><p>It is likely a relief for both MLW and WWE that the lawsuit got settled before things got worse. Regardless, what’s done is done and now both parties can move onto other things besides the lawsuit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What do you think of WWE nad MLW finally settling their lawsuit?
