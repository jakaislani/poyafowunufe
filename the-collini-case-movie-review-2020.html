<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The Collini Case movie review (2020)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Still, Kreuzpaintner milks the story’s mysterious nature for all it’s worth for a while, at least until numerous sign-posts spell out the secrets all too soon throughout an overstretched running time. Happenings in a fancy hotel lead us into the tale, revealing a 70-year-old Italian named Fabrizio Collini (<a href=#>Franco Nero</a>) in the lobby, confessing to murdering someone while covered in blood. Only three months into his career, the fresh-off-the-boat attorney Caspar Leinen (Elyas M’Barek) finds himself court-appointed to this highly publicized, top-shelf criminal case as the defense attorney to the until-then law-abiding citizen Collini, who simply refuses to spare a single word like he’s taken a vow of silence.</p><p>But everything gets tangled when Caspar realizes that the victim is the country’s well-regarded industrial tycoon Hans Meyer, who’s pretty much fathered him throughout the '80s when he was a little boy raised by a single mom. Further complicating this already shady conflict of interest is Caspar’s former law professor Richard Mattinger (<a href=#>Heiner Lauterbach</a>) serving as the young man’s fierce adversary and the complex involvement of Meyer’s granddaughter Johanna (<a href=#>Alexandra Maria Lara</a> of “Rush”), Caspar’s romantic interest from the past.</p><p>Disclosing its&nbsp;three separate timelines in increments—present day, the '80s and the World War II era, with thousands of its Nazi criminals gone unpunished because of the so-called Dreher Law of 1968—“The Collini Case” crawls towards its eventual but obvious reveal a bit inelegantly. Along the way, a family tragedy involving Johanna’s brother and Caspar superfluously comes into play, making one feel like a big informational and emotional piece from the novel somehow went missing while being transposed into the film. Also undercooked is Caspar’s half-Turkish background. The film name-checks his heritage, but treats it like an afterthought all the same, even when Caspar’s biological dad who’s deserted his Turkish wife makes a surprise appearance and becomes an oblique clue for the ultimate exposé.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lk6S5rbXNomScmaOaeq671aKcZqqVq7amw4xrZ2to</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./georgie-glen.html><span>←</span><span>Georgie Glen</span></a>
