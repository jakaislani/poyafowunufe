Of course, by the time the opening credits had even started on Martin Campbell’s 2006 reboot, the doubters had been well and truly won over by the bruising black-and-white prologue.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>In a new interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, casting director Debbie McWilliams recalled the intense backlash towards Craig at the time, admitting that it was startling to witness firsthand.</p><p>“It was unbelievably negative, I have to say. The press response was awful and I felt so sorry for him, but in a funny kind of a way I think it almost spurred him on to do his damndest to prove everybody wrong. The whole way through the film, stuff would come out about he couldn’t walk and talk, he couldn’t run, he couldn’t drive a car properly, so much stuff which was completely and utterly untrue. And he just kept his head down, got on with the job, and then the film came out and everybody went, ‘Oh wow, I think we quite like him after all’. He’s going to be a tough act to follow.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EEC2y4nWwAMpwpu.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EEC2y4iXoAE-EXn.jpeg><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=false>The leading man has been open with his struggles over becoming a household name overnight, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealing that Hugh Jackman offered a helping hand</a>, having experienced the same thing some years previously when Bryan Singer’s X-Men turned the relative unknown into a movie star in the space of less than two hours. No Time to Die is almost upon us, and those who decried Craig at the beginning will no doubt be there on opening day to watch him bow out as <strong>James Bond</strong>, in what’s hopefully a fitting swansong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZqllah6o7vNnWScmaOptq%2BzjJ2gq52TqbyzedGempqknKh6qrrTnqWsnV2XrqS3y5qqoWWRnK6qutKtZJ2Znp6yrXnCq5iin18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./its-like-the-citizen-kane-of-video-games-john-murdy-discusses-the-pressure-of-bringing-the-last-of-us-to-halloween-horror-nights-at-universal-studios.html><span>←</span><span>Its like the Citizen Kane of video games: John Murdy discusses the pressure of bringing</span></a>
