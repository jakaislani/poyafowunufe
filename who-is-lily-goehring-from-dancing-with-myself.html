Lily Goehring, a 16-year-old Las Vegas native, defeated 13-year-old Ayanna in the final round with her excellent dance performance to Demi Lovato’s song Confident.&nbsp;The winner of Dancing with Myself intends to use the $25,000 prize money to purchase a vehicle. Lily is deaf in one ear and says she frequently feels the rhythm instead of listening to it.</p><h2>Lily Goehring: School, Academy, and More</h2><p>Lily Goehring relocated to Las Vegas four years ago. She began dancing at the age of two and attended the Dance Etc. school in Grand Forks for 10 years. Goehring is a middle school student. In an interview with the Grand Forks Herald, Lily stated of her academy:</p><p>“They’re my primary dancing family.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Lily-Goehring-2.jpg alt="Lily Goehring" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lily often uploads videos on Instagram and Tik-Tok. Lily was last seen in a Blink 182 music video and in the TV sitcom Chicken Girls. She spoke about her experience on Dancing with Myself:</p><p>“When I was there shooting for the show, I knew it was going to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I was really trying to enjoy myself. I took everything in. There, I met the most amazing individuals that have inspired me.”</p><p>Lily also noted that getting into the show was a difficult procedure, saying,</p><p>“I couldn’t even put a figure on everything – films, interviews, papers. I felt quite lucky to have been chosen.”</p><p>Lily defeated Ricky Pond in the Freestyle Battle Round. The judges spared Lily from the losing row in the third competition, The Dance Along. Lily informed viewers that she always maintained a cheerful attitude no matter what.&nbsp;Lily was teamed with Becca in the Collaborative challenge, however, they failed to wow the audience. Instead, the judges and Tia Stokes rescued her. Her performance in Round 5 wowed both the crowd and the judges. Nick Jonas said,</p><p>“Lily, what was that?”</p><p>Shakira also complimented on her performance, stating,</p><p>“I believe Lily is missing some vertebrae.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Lily-Goehring-3.jpg alt="Lily Goehring" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lily won the Week 4 challenge because to her flexible physique and creative steps.</p><h2>Who were the other Dancing with Myself participants tonight?</h2><p>Tonight’s Dancing with Myself candidates were:</p><ul><li>Abey</li><li>Ayanna</li><li>Tia Stokes</li><li>Leah Baxter</li><li>Sirdarius Rashod</li><li>Lily Kate</li><li>Nick Gray</li><li>Ricky Pond</li><li>Jake Taylor</li><li>Becca Robinson</li><li>Molly Prewitt</li><li>Payton Beall</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuuMilsGafn5q1s7XNoGSfqp%2BieqWtzZygp59drLa1tIymsKydnJt8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-difference-between-muscle-spasm-and-spasticity.html><span>←</span><span>What is the difference between muscle spasm and spasticity?</span></a>
