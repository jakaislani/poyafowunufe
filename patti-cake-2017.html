<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Patti Cake$ movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2017)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Of course they're wrong, because this film is "<a href=#>8 Mile</a>," with a big woman in the lead, and set not in Michigan but in the post-industrial jumble of northern New Jersey (<a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a> country; he even has a song on the soundtrack). The film turns into "Purple Rain" when it shifts focus to Patti's fraught relationship with her mother Barb, brilliantly played by actress and singer <a href=#>Bridget Everett</a>. Like Prince's "Kid" in his 1984 movie breakthrough, who struggled to define himself apart from his dad (<a href=#>Clarence Williams III</a>), a failed professional pianist and wife-beating drunk,&nbsp;Patti is simultaneously inspired and embarrassed by Barb, a onetime rock singer who was on the verge of a commercial stardom when she got pregnant with Patti.&nbsp;</p><p>Barb holds Patti's existence against her at the same time that she sincerely expresses love for her. The scenes between them are the best and most powerful element of "Patti Cake$." Everett's history of using her considerable weight and height as comic fuel in standup and cabaret made her a perfect choice for this role, but she's as strong in the arguments and drunk scenes as she is when she's singing or cracking wise. If there's any justice, this should be a career-redefining performance on the order of Frank Sinatra's in "From Here to Eternity."</p><p>If you saw "Purple Rain," "8 Mile" or half a dozen other films about struggling musicians, you know how this tale will resolve: with Patti trying and failing to navigate one road to success (getting a mix tape into the hands of a famous rapper) only to manage a 98-yard dash to victory anyway, via a local rap competition. You also know in your bones that the support of Patti's chain-smoking, handicapped grandmother (<a href=#>Cathy Moriarty</a>) will be the wind beneath her wings (and a financial boost, too), that there'll be plenty of salty-adorable scenes between them as the story unfolds, and that grandma will die before the last reel to give the movie another powerhouse acting moment (as well as a strong link to another plainly obvious inspiration, the "<a href=#>Rocky</a>" series, which made sure to have a tearjerking deathbed or funeral scene for a parent or mentor figure in nearly every installment).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46pmK2smWKworfEZmlpaWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ian-patrick-williams.html><span>←</span><span>Ian Patrick Williams movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
