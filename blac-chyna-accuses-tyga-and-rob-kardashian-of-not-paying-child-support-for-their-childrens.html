The tweet stated:</p><p>“I had to give up three of my automobiles yesterday… My reasons are… principles, values, bringing a single mother, no support, and I’m a MAMA.”</p><p>In another tweet, she said that she was unmarried and did not pay child support. Despite her loss, she said that she was focusing on being grateful. A fan seemed to criticize the model by referring to Kardashian’s more visible efforts with Dream and writing:</p><p>“Is child support necessary when the other parent is actively involved in the kid’s life, taking the child on days and dressing and feeding the youngster?”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Single no support child support</p><p>— Blac Chyna (@BLACCHYNA) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">March 30, 2022</a></p><p>Chyna reacted with:</p><p>“No, it’s when the other parent’s parenting is effective; it’s called coparenting.” Greedy parents, on the other hand, strive to receive child support since they’re not doing anything [rocket ship emoji].”</p><p>After being accused of not paying child support, Tyga and Rob Kardashian hit out at their ex-fiancée, Chyna. According to Kardashian:</p><p>“I spend $37,000 every year for my daughter’s education.” I am in charge of all medical expenses. All of her extracurricular activities are paid for by me. From Tuesday to Saturday, I am responsible for my kid. “I’m not sure why I’d pay child support.”</p><p>Tyga’s response was as follows:</p><p>“I pay $40,000 a year for my son’s school, and he lives with me from Monday to Saturday.” “I’m not sure why I’d pay child support.”</p><h2>A look into Blac Chyna’s personal life</h2><p>In 2011, she began dating rapper Tyga, with whom she had a kid, King Cairo Stevenson, in 2012. They divorced in 2014 when Tyga started dating Kylie Jenner. Tyga and Jenner’s relationship sparked multiple social media feuds between Chyna and Jenner, which ended in 2016 when the former started dating Jenner’s half-brother Rob Kardashian. Dream Renee Kardashian, their daughter, was born in November 2016.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blac-Chyna-2.jpg alt="Blac Chyna" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rob Kardashian confirmed his divorce from Chyna in a December 2016 Instagram post. They reunited a few days later, but they divorced again in 2017.&nbsp;In 2019, Chyna and Kardashian reconciled their support feud.

Since the verdict, Chyna has not requested child support.</p><h2>All about Blac Chyna</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Blac-Chyna-3.jpg alt="Blac Chyna" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Angela Renée White, nicknamed Blac Chyna, rose to prominence as a stunt double for Nicki Minaj in Kanye West’s Monster music video.
