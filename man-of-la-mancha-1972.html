<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Man of La Mancha movie review (1972)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The best movie musicals never have depended on bailing-out operations by their directors. The truly great musical directors like <a href=#>Vincente Minnelli</a>, <a href=#>Stanley Doren</a> and Gene Kelly usually were concerned with creating a fantasy outside the camera and then photographing it.</p><p>When a dancer like Astaire is working, you undermine his artistry if you move the camera a lot, and edit incessantly. Audiences need a stable visual base to appreciate good choreography. They don't get it in "Man of La Mancha."</p><p>The mystery of Peter O'Toole deepens with the release of this movie. He is a film actor of considerable talent, granted. But what possesses directors to cast him in musicals?</p><p>He can't sing and he knows he can't sing. So he was in "<a href=#>Goodbye, Mr. Chips</a>" (1970), which was good anyway because they stuck to the compelling story line and rarely showed him singing. They did low-keyed voice-overs instead, and let <a href=#>Petula Clark</a> handle the real musical stuff.</p><p>But now O'Toole is back in another musical; he's the busiest musical star in movies! Why?</p><p>The only performance that really survives the movie is Sophia Loren's. She can sing, more or less, and she can also radiate warmth and concern.</p><p>She has kind of a thankless role (they've cast her as the whore with the heart of gold again), but she concentrates on acting; she doesn't relax because it's only a musical. So her role works because we care about it.</p><p>The people who made "Man of La Mancha," and who were no doubt filled with the best of intentions, made two mistakes.</p><p>The first was to make a film out of an essentially uninspired musical play. The second was not to believe that Cervantes really meant it when he wrote "Don Quixote."</p><p>There's a message there, but it isn't to dream the impossible dream. It's to tilt at windmills instead. Windmills can't tilt back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46mmKdln5t6ra2Mppinm5iWenKFlms%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ella-schuman-wiki-whats-her-net-worth-family-and-relationship.html><span>←</span><span>Ella Schuman Wiki: Whats Her Net Worth?
