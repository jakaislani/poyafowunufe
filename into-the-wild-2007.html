<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Into the Wild movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2007)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#>Sean Penn</a>'s spellbinding film adaptation of this book stays close to the source. We meet Christopher (<a href=#>Emile Hirsch</a>) as an idealistic dreamer, in reaction against his proud parents (<a href=#>William Hurt</a> and <a href=#>Marcia Gay Harden</a>) and his bewildered sister (<a href=#>Jena Malone</a>).</p><p>He had good grades at Emory; his future in law school was right there in his grasp. Why did he disappear from their lives, why was his car found abandoned, where was he, and why, why, why?</p><p>He keeps journals in which he sees himself in the third person as a heroic loner, renouncing civilization, returning to the embrace of nature. In centuries past such men might have been saints, retreating to a cave or hidden hermitage, denying themselves all pleasures except subsistence. He sees himself not as homeless, but as a man freed from homes.</p><p>In the book, Krakauer traces his movements through the memories of people he encounters on his journey. It was an impressive reporting achievement to track them down, and Penn's film affectionately embodies them in strong performances. These are people who take in the odd youth, feed him, shelter him, give him clothes, share their lives, mentor him and worry as he leaves to continue his quest, which seems to them, correctly, as doomed.</p><p>By now McCandless has renamed himself Alexander Supertramp. He is validated by his lifestyle choice. He meets such people as Rainey and Jan (Brian Dieker and <a href=#>Catherine Keener</a>), leftover hippies still happily rejecting society, and Wayne (<a href=#>Vince Vaughn</a>), a hard-drinking, friendly farmer. The most touching contact he makes is with Ron (<a href=#>Hal Holbrook</a>), an older man who sees him clearly and with apprehension, and begins to think of him as a wayward grandson. Christopher lectures this man, who has seen it all, on what he is missing and asks him to follow him up a steep hillside to see the next horizon. Ron tries, before he admits he is no longer in condition.</p><p>And then McCandless disappears from the maps of memory, into unforgiving Alaska. Yes, it looks beautiful. It is all he dreamed of. He finds an abandoned bus where no bus should be and makes it his home. He tries hunting, not very successfully. He lives off the land, but the land is a zero-tolerance system. From his journals and other evidence, Penn reconstructs his final weeks. Emile Hirsch plays him in a hypnotic performance, turning skeletal, his eyes sinking into his skull while they still burn with zeal. It is great acting, and more than acting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46ipa2nXam1pnnWoqOdZWJlfXg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-owns-liquid-death.html><span>←</span><span>Who Owns Liquid Death?
