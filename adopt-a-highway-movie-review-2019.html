<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Adopt a Highway movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>"Adopt a Highway" opens with a cacophony of voices, President <a href=#>Bill Clinton</a> saying we must be "tough on crime," speechifying about the "three strikes law" and mandatory sentencing for drug-related crimes. The so-called War on Drugs was a disaster, resulting in extremely long sentences for minor offenses. People are still in jail for basically being addicts, or even just adjacent to addicts. ("<a href=#>The Sentence</a>," a documentary about one family's attempt to get their family member out of prison, is really about the insanity of mandatory sentences.) Many states have overturned laws like the "three strikes law", but that's cold comfort for someone like Russell, who got 25 years for having an ounce of pot on him. He emerges into a totally changed world. He has never been on the internet. He doesn't know what Google is. His parents both died while he was in prison. He blinks into the sunlight like he's a mole emerging from underground.</p><p>Finding Ella is the turning point in this gentle story, and it's a pretty top-heavy plot maneuver, out of a very different kind of movie. Russell does not call the police. He takes Ella "home" with him and tries to take care of her. She's been abandoned, her future wiped out by what was done to her. It's not hard to see the connections Russell may feel. Russell, a child-man, who won awards as a teenager for his participation in an "Adopt a Highway" campaign, also has no past and a limited future. The scenes with Ella have a real intimacy, and even charm, but it's a swerve from the haunting opening sequences, where Russell walks around, squinting at a world that seems so big, a world he no longer recognizes. He rides a roller coaster, just for the hell of it, agog at the blinking lights, at the sheer heady freedom of it.</p><p>There are a couple of other incidents along the way, things that happen to Russell, but "Adopt a Highway" never coalesces into a whole. It jump-starts itself from "bit" to "bit", more like an old television episodic. Holding it all together is Hawke's performance, weighted down with the heaviness of injustice, a shyness about authority figures in general, a passivity which makes people look twice at him and then back away. His hair is stringy, his salt-and-pepper beard thick, and pain and confusion practically shimmer around him like a migraine aura. There's a really fun sequence in an internet cafe, where a helpful employee shows Russell what email is, and then asks to take a picture with him, this rare creature who has never been on the internet before. These sequences are sensitive and observant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46am6iopGKubrTIoJ%2BwmaliurDCyJ5kq52mnrK4eZFpaHI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mercedes-mason.html><span>←</span><span>Mercedes Mason Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
