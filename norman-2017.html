<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Norman movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2017)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>With his ever-present overcoat, hat and ear buds, Norman is always walking and talking, always working it. He’s warm and friendly to everyone he meets, fancying himself as a magnanimous, well-connected power broker who’s eager to introduce people to each other for their mutual benefit. Please, just let him do this one favor for you—it would be his honor. But it’s clear that no one really knows Norman, and even though Gere is on screen for nearly the entirety of the film, we realize by the end that we don’t really know Norman, either. And that’s intentional; Cedar has made him a tantalizing mystery.</span></p><p><span>What Norman is after, though, becomes achingly clear: not the money that closing a big deal would bring, but rather the prestige, something that’s more amorphous and harder to acquire. He finally achieves some semblance of the access and respect he long has sought when he befriends an Israeli diplomat named Micha Eshel (an excellent <a href=#>Lior Ashkenazi</a>, who also co-starred in Cedar’s 2011 film “<a href=#>Footnote</a>”), who’s visiting New York at a vulnerable time in his political career. A scene in which Norman follows Eshel into the Manhattan Lanvin store and helps him try on expensive suits and shoes plays like an exquisitely tense, delicate dance.</span></p><p><span>Three years later</span><span>, when Eshel becomes Israel’s prime minister, he remembers his eager-to-please pal and welcomes Norman into this inner circle—to the frustration of the seasoned political aides who already occupy spots there.&nbsp;But as Norman begins making promises he can’t keep to friends throughout New York’s Jewish community and getting in deeper over his head, his exaggerations and outright lies come back to haunt him. Not only does he find it increasingly difficult to maintain his well-honed persona, he also finds that being near the center of power isn’t as satisfying as he’d always imagined.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46npqulkaN6c3yQcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicole-scherzinger-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Nicole Scherzinger Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Career</span></a>
