 Answer
When a crystal has absorbed an excessive amount of energy, it becomes hazy or dark. Although not all crystals are capable of doing so, some are able to do so because they are unable to cope with the quantity of energy they are receiving. To aid in the healing of this crystal, you may set it in soil or even a bowl of water with salt (if the crystal can be submerged in water) to be washed and purified."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
