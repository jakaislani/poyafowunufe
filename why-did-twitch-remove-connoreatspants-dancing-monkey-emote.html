They are similar to emoticons, but Twitch-specific. They give creators an opportunity to express themselves without having to use words, and are truly an integral part of the Twitch culture. However, in the last year bewildered creators have noticed more and more guardrails around the types of emotes they can use, and in the case of some, suspension or banning if the wrong ones are used.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=561 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>The emote in question here is a dancing monkey who’s clearly air-thrusting with a smile on its face. According to Twitch, the monkey’s “nudity” and “sexual content” was enough to warrant an immediate dismissal from the site. It’s “Gasm”-style nature contained “sexualized torsos or bodily fluids” which is a no-no for the platform. Considering the fact that monkeys don’t typically wear clothes and are by nature naked, the “sexual” content here is clearly the air-thrusting.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>Fans of ConnorEatsPants were quick to point out that they too have been on the receiving end of Twitch’s iron fist, with one user (@TheWillNeff) saying, “I have lost 3 now.”</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>Twitch hasn’t been shy about their process for reviewing custom emotes. In a recent blog post they <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> their new computer-based learning model which assists in picking and choosing which custom emotes are suitable for the site and which aren’t. Has this new computer-based learning model caused the premature removal of custom emotes or has Twitch truly cracked down on their community guidelines?</p><p data-characters=152 data-current-count=152 data-injectable=false>Twitch hasn’t commented yet on their decision to remove the connor6Monkey emote, but if or when they do, ConnorEatsPants will surely let us know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTYZpuinF2pxKrAwqFkq52dpMOmecKopaenopqutb%2FPmqWtq12Zrq%2BvyKeeZqWfo7imxYyepKislWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-lowe.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Sean Lowe?
