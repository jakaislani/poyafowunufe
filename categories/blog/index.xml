Answer
When a signal is referred to be ‚Äòactive low‚Äô in a digital circuit, it signifies that the signal will execute its function when the logic level of the signal is zero. It is necessary to ‚Äúpull‚Äù the pin LOW if it is an active-low pin by connecting it to ground.

The idea that a found footage film could play off the era of hit TV shows like ‚ÄúGhost Hunters‚Äù and take us to a real location to mine it for atmosphere is a great one, but director Taylor Ri‚Äôchard isn‚Äôt really interested in Lafitte.</description></item><item><title>Actor Andrs Garca Died: What Was His Cause Of Death?</title><link>/actor-andres-garcia-died-what-was-his-cause-of-death.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/actor-andres-garcia-died-what-was-his-cause-of-death.html</guid><description>Andr√©s Garc√≠a died&amp;nbsp;on April 4, leaving four children.&amp;nbsp;Andr√©s Jr., Leonardo and Andrea followed in their father‚Äôs footsteps into acting, while the others chose not to be public figures.

He enlisted in the Marines. He doesn't actually say if he has killed anyone or not, but the director, Danfung Dennis, who was embedded with Harris' Echo Company, followed him in action, and we see that he has grown into a natural leader of men. Some of the film's most involving scenes show him debating village elders (through an interpreter) about the role of America in Afghanistan; he sincerely believes he is helping to bring them freedom, and finds it hard to answer their statements that they want to be left alone by both the Americans and the Taliban.</description></item><item><title>FOXs Second Chance is Depressingly Awful | TV/Streaming</title><link>/foxs-second-chance-is-depressingly-awful.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/foxs-second-chance-is-depressingly-awful.html</guid><description>FOX has basically patented the high-concept procedural show. ‚ÄúSleepy Hollow‚Äù and ‚ÄúMinority Report‚Äù are essentially case-of-the-week shows, but they feel like they're twisted just enough that they could emerge from nowhere else than FOX.

We are not prudes. We are prepared to laugh. But what these movies, including "Joe Dirt," often do not understand is that the act of being buried in crap is not in and of itself funny.
Third-graders might think so (they're big on fart jokes, too), but trust me: When Joe Dirt thinks he has an atom bomb, until the cap gets knocked off, and a geyser of brown crud pours out, and he just stands there while it covers him--that's not funny.</description></item><item><title>Judy Farrell Net Worth 2024</title><link>/judy-farrell-net-worth-241957.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/judy-farrell-net-worth-241957.html</guid><description>Age, Biography and Wiki üí∞ Net worth: $1.9 Million (2024) Judy Farrell, a well-known TV actress based in Oklahoma, has gained significant wealth throughout her successful career.
