Comedian and actress Ayo Edebiri may not seem like a shoo-in for the techno-mindfreak series Black Mirror but she completely owns her minimal screen-time in the series’ season 6 premiere. The Bear actress has already more than proved her acting chops, but her stint in Black Mirror showcases her ability to make any part, no matter how small, believable. Edebiri appears in the episode “Joan is Awful,”as Sandy, an unfortunate employee who is let go at the beginning of the episode by Joan, played by Annie Murphy (Schitt’s Creek).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Best Skyr Icelandic Yogurts on the Market [Taste Test]</h2><time>May 21, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../the-best-skyr-icelandic-yogurts.html></a>
The best skyr is creamy, rich, and chock-full of dairy. At least that’s what I’ve learned after tasting a bunch of Icelandic yogurts.

If you also don’t know anything about skyr, you can read about the thick, icelandic-style yogurt here!</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Danika Brace</h2><time>May 21, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../best-bbq-chips.html></a>
The best BBQ chips are crunchy, savory, and sweet. And it’s easy to find a good BBQ chip. I believe BBQ potato chips are the crème de la crème of fried, sliced potatoes. The smoky, sweet seasoning and the fatty, oily chip are a true match made in heaven. I eat them by the fistful so I was thrilled (and highly qualified) to lead this BBQ potato chip taste test.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/58/>← Prev Page</a>
