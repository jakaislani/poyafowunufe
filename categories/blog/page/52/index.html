<a href=../../../../htc-evo-3d-vs-motorola-photon-4g-best-sprint-phone.html></a>
Software Both the Photon 4G and EVO 3D run Gingerbread, although the Photon sports a slightly newer version (2.3.4 vs 2.3.3).

The EVO 3D ships with HTC's Sense 3.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jack Giarraputo movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Jun 3, 2024</time>
