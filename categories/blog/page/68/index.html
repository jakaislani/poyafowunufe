I know what you’re thinking. More talk of Brie Larson quitting the MCU? Haven’t we already sung this song many times over? Recommended Videos Well, on that you would be correct, as the unfair onslaught of hostile criticism the Oscar-winning actress has had to endure over her Marvel career so far has often led to rumors that she might be about to call it quits or even be fired by the studio for apparently doing “a bad job.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>J.

Buddy, it turns out, took a piece of others people's action, like Charlie before him, just not blatantly. Envelopes of cash never changed hands as far as we know, but Buddy as mayor didn't see a problem with taking a piece of a real estate development that used eminent domain to seize other people's land. Nor did he have a problem with using a prisoner on work release to build a deck onto his home for no pay.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Heidis Spicy Green Soup</h2><time>Apr 29, 2024</time>

I know – it’s not quite soup season yet, but you probably still have bunches of&nbsp;summery herbs, and this recipe is such a wonderful&nbsp;way to use them.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Final Project movie review (2016)</h2><time>Apr 29, 2024</time>

Local folklore tells the story of the Lafitte Plantation in Vacherie, Louisiana, once reportedly the inspiration for Tara in “Gone with the Wind” but now a run-down, dilapidated building, overrun by foliage and unoccupied. The idea that a found footage film could play off the era of hit TV shows like “Ghost Hunters” and take us to a real location to mine it for atmosphere is a great one, but director Taylor Ri’chard isn’t really interested in Lafitte.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/67/>← Prev Page</a>
