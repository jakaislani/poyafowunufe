In a recent interview with Comedy Hype, Love revealed he only got paid $2,500 for starring in the movie and that was enough for people to pounce.</p><p>But comedian Michael Blackson — who appeared in the 2000 sequel Next Friday — isn’t down with the Ice Cube slander. On Wednesday (December 29), he defended the N.W.A legend with a pair of Twitter posts and seemed perfectly fine with his salary at the time.</p><p>“@icecube is not to blamed for us getting paid so little it’s the film industry’s pay scale,” he wrote. “I got paid $800 a day when I did Next Friday plus overtime I made $1200 for my one day’s work of ‘I can’t get giggy with this shit.’ Thanks to next Friday I became the biggest African comic.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@icecube</a> is not to blamed for us getting paid so little it’s the film industry’s pay scale.

The 1995 Friday movie cost $2.3 million to make. Shot in 20 days. Faizon worked 1 day, maybe 2. All the actors got paid scale to do the movie. They could’ve simple said ‘No’ but they didn’t.

If Cube said, ‘Faizon, there’s no money.
