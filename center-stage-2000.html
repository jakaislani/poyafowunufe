<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Center Stage movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2000)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>It is about the union of hard work and artistic success. To be a world-class ballet dancer is to be an athlete of the highest order, and if you look at ballet as a sport, it has many Michael Jordans and the NBA had only one. The movie casts real dancers in many of the roles, and that provides an obvious standard of excellence that gives the movie an underlying authenticity.</p><p><a href=#>Ethan Stiefel</a>, considered by many to be the best male dancer in the world, plays Cooper, the lead--the star of the company, who has just lost his girlfriend to Jonathan (<a href=#>Peter Gallagher</a>), the company's head. He becomes attracted to Jody (<a href=#>Amanda Schull</a>), one of the new students, and in a predictable progression invites her into his bed and into the new ballet he is creating.</p><p>Predictable, yes, but not with all the soap-opera payoffs we might fear. The movie uses the materials of melodrama, but is gentle with them; it's oriented more in the real world, and doesn't jack up every conflict and love story into an overwrought crisis. That restraint is especially useful in creating the character Eva Rodriguez (<a href=#>Zoe Saldana</a>), the class rebel, who talks back to the teacher (<a href=#>Donna Murphy</a>), comes late to rehearsals, has a bad attitude--and yet actually has the best attitude of all because she dances out of her love for dance, not because of ambition or duty.</p><p>Some of the other students are not so lucky. One has been pushed into dancing by her mother. One has a body-image problem. And so on. But a lot of these kids are pretty normal, apart from their demanding profession. In a dance club, Sergei (Ilia Kulik), from Russia, tries to pick up two women.They want to know what he does. He says he's a ballet dancer, and she turns away. With the next woman, he has more luck. "Russian Mafia," he explains.</p><p>The movie doesn't force it, but it has the pleasures of a musical. It ends with two big ballet numbers, wonderfully staged and danced, and along the way there are rehearsals and scenes in a Broadway popular dance studio that have a joy and freedom. Film is a wonderful way to look at dance, because it gets you closer and varies the point of view, but since the death of the Hollywood musical there hasn't been enough of it. "Center Stage" has moments of joy and moments of insight, and is about both human nature and the inhuman demands of ballet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cnKeslad6tMDAoJxmamBlfQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-celsius-flavor.html><span>←</span><span>Best Celsius Flavor: We Tasted and Ranked All 18 Celsius Flavors</span></a>
