She asked for $35 million in damages, according to the <a href=#>AP</a>.&nbsp;Holloway's attorney, Taylor Wilson, told <a href=#>Courthouse News Service</a>, "There are constitutional limits to the media's right to entertain and what families must endure in these situations, and that that constitutional line was crossed here."</p><p dir=ltr>As reported by <a href=#>USA Today</a>, Oxygen defended the series, saying, "We had hoped, along with Mr. Holloway, that the information was going to provide closure. We cannot comment further on ongoing litigation." Dave Holloway (above) participated in the NBC Universal documentary. He reportedly asked Beth for a DNA sample but was not listed as a defendant in Beth's litigation. As of 2023, the lawsuit has yet to be settled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kXFqcmlmZMSprdNmn5qooJq7prCMp5itmZyasm60zqWjqK%2BRrsBuvMCrnKeso2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./topper-guild.html><span>←</span><span>Topper Guild- Age, Net Worth, Height, Girlfriend, Career, Nationality</span></a>
