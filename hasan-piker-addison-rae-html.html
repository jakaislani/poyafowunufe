She blew up on TikTok in late 2019, and now, she has over 83 million followers on the platform. In just two years, she became an influential person with a massive fanbase.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>So, it is not a surprise that she has overgrown TikTok and expanded her brand. She has her own makeup company, makes music, and is now entering the movie industry.&nbsp;</p><p>She entered Hollywood with a bang with her new Netflix teen rom-com, He's All That. The movie is a gender-swap remake of the 1999 classic, She's All That.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The movie did poorly amongst the critics, and <a href=# rel=follow>Rae was trolled</a> for her acting skills. Regardless, this was a massive milestone for&nbsp;Rae.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>If a person has achieved success at a young age, it is no surprise that there will be many people to drag them down. Unfortunately, the&nbsp;TikTok star&nbsp;is in that position right now.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She is a 20-year-old who has built a colossal empire, and many people question her success. One such person to do so&nbsp;is Twitch streamer <a href=# rel=follow>Hasan Piker</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Addison Rae and Demonic Sacrifices?!</h2><p>On August 31, 2021, Piker took to Twitter to join the bandwagon of questioning Rae's success. However, his take on the situation was hilarious while still getting a dig at He's All That actress.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Piker said that Rae must have made some "demonic sacrifices" to appease the gods of fame. Basically, he could not fathom how much clout Rae got&nbsp;without having "many discernable skills."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>idc about addison rae but every-time i see videos of her i feel like she must’ve done some demonic sacrifices to get to that level of clout w/out many discernible skills. i’m sure plenty people feel this way about me as well tho — hasanabi (@hasanthehun) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 31, 2021</a></p><p>Selling one's soul to the devil is common accusation celebrities get when they get attention from the public. So, Rae getting such accusations is&nbsp;expected at this point. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Piker was aware of his situation as well. So he ended his tweet, assuming many people feel the same about him. And, of course, he was right.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hasan Piker Gets Dragged</h2><p>He joined Twitch in March 2018, and now he has become&nbsp;one of Twitch's most popular and subscribed streamers. He usually covers news, plays a range of video games, and talks politics from a socialist standpoint.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>As soon as Piker tweeted his stance on Rae and demonic sacrifices, he started getting roasted via replies. Rae's fans came for him and questioned his rise to success. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Aside from being attractive, what skills would you put forth to defend yourself from such claims? I don't see anything, Hasan. But I'm asking -- honestly -- can you tell us what your special skills are, that warranted 3mil housing for example? Doctorate? Anything? Nephew? — dggAgent (@dggAgent) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 31, 2021</a></p><p>One user, @dggAgent, questioned the Twitch streamer about his house and skills. Piker recently bought a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">West Hollywood Home</a>, which had sent the internet into a frenzy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After an article claimed that his new home in West Hollywood cost him a staggering $2.74 million, the internet exploded in a heated discussion. Many people regarded him as hypocritical, considering that he identifies as a socialist.</p><p>@dggAgent dragged Piker for making such a statement while he is in the same position. The Twitter user asked Piker&nbsp;to defend himself by listing down his unique skills.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>seems like meritocracy is a lie. maybe we should create a system that offers true equality of opportunity. — hasanabi (@hasanthehun) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 31, 2021</a></p><p>Piker dogged @dggAgent's questions but&nbsp;replied calling meritocracy a lie and said that a system offering "true equality of opportunity" should be created.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Similarly, many other people defended Rae, saying she could dance, but Piker does reaction videos on Twitch.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>At least she can dance, you just do reaction content and lie about being a socialist — Hypno (@Hypnostraw) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 31, 2021</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>You passively watch other people's content for millions of dollars lmao — globe emoji (@aftr__noon) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 31, 2021</a></p><p>Regardless of this back and forth, both Rae and Piker are talented and successful in their own right. Both of them are succeeding on their own and will continue to do so in the future.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKCRqK6vec%2Biop6qXZaxpbXSqKVmqpGae6nAzKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./snoop-dogg-coffee-indoxyz-news.html><span>←</span><span>Forget Gin and JuiceSnoop Dogg Has a Coffee Brand Now</span></a>
