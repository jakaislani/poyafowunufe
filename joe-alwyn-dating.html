Swift and Alwyn haven’t said anything about the comments, and so far they’ve been able to keep their relationship out of the spotlight.</p><p>Fans should expect the same kind of silence from the couple about the rumors that they are getting married.</p><p>Fans who follow Swift closely know that she is more likely to hint about her current relationship in her songs than to talk about it in public. She did this with her relationship with Alwyn in songs like “London Boy,” “Dress,” “Call It What You Want,” and “Gorgeous,” to name a few.</p><p>When did the Grammy-winning singer and the star of Conversations With Friends meet?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift Meet?</h2><p>No one knows for sure when Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn first met, but most Taylor Swift fans think it was at the Met Gala in May 2016. Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, hosts the prestigious and star-studded event. The year Swift and Alwyn went, the theme was “Manus X Machina: Fashion in the Age of Technology.”</p><p>Fans think that’s when Swift and Alwyn met because of the song Dress, which was on Swift’s Reputation album in 2017. “Flashback to when we met/You had a buzz cut and my hair was bleached,” says the song “Dress.”</p><p>Fans with sharp eyes have figured out that the lyrics are about how Alwyn and Swift dressed at the Met Gala that same year. Alwyn wore a Burberry suit and his head was really shaved, while Swift wore a silver Louis Vuitton dress and had a bleach blonde bob cut.</p><p>Swift was dating DJ Calvin Harris at the time of the Met Gala. She has never said if the song is about Alwyn or not. Even though Swift and Alwyn met in May 2016, they didn’t start dating until October 2016.</p><p>Swift put copies of pages from her journals on the cover of her 2019 album Lover. In one entry from January 3, 2017, she wrote, “I’m basically hiding out in London, trying to keep us safe from the bad world that just wants to mess things up. “We’ve been together for three months and no one has found out. I don’t want anything to change, so I want it to stay that way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Joe-Alwyn-and-Taylor-Swift-1024x683.jpg><p>Swift kept dropping hints about her relationship with Alwyn. In the song “Gorgeous,” which is also on Reputation, Swift sings about falling in love while already in a relationship. She sings, “You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk,” which could be a reference to Alwyn’s British accent.</p><p>Swift and Alwyn have kept quiet about their relationship, only giving small hints about it in interviews or through Swift’s songs.</p><p>Swift talked about her relationship with Alwyn with Rolling Stone in November 2020. She said, “I think that knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now have made my life feel more like a real life and less like a storyline for tabloids to talk about.”</p><p>Alwyn recently talked to The Wall Street Journal about the constant rumors that he is getting married. He told The Wall Street Journal, “If I had a pound for every time I think I’ve been told I’m engaged, I’d have a lot of pound coins.”</p><p>I mean, if the answer was yes, I wouldn’t say, and if it was no, I wouldn’t say either.”</p><p>Read More</p><ul><li class="is-title post-title"><a href=#>Who is Selena Gomez Dating Now?
