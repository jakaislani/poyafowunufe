The Hamilton star succeeds reigning season 24 champ Rashad Jennings as the latest celebrity to get a new door stop Mirrorball. Len Goodman said Jordan is "the most complete male celebrity ever on Dancing With the Stars," while Bruno Tonioli praised him as being "right up there with the best we've ever seen on this show." The win also marks Lindsay's first Mirrorball trophy in six seasons. She previously came in fourth with Wanya Morris, third with Calvin Johnson, Jr., and second with David Ross.</p><p>Following their victory, Jordan and Lindsay didn't get to say anything, because, well, the show ran out of time. It was perhaps the biggest misstep of the entire season, especially for fans who propelled Jordan to victory and would have loved to have heard his reaction instead of just seeing it. Apparently, that's what Good Morning America is for. Still, not cool you guys.</p><p>As expected, <a href=#>Lindsey Stirling</a> and Mark Ballas came in second place, with <a href=#>Frankie Muniz</a> and Witney Carson taking third. All three couples will now head to New York to appear on GMA and act as if they're thrilled to have to dance again on an hour of sleep.</p><p>In other news, both Jordan and Frankie were announced as the celebrity guests joining <a data-offer-url=http://www.dwtstour.com class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"http://www.dwtstour.com"}' href=# rel=nofollow>Dancing With the Stars Live!: Light Up the Night</a> this winter. It's the first time since the tour began that two contestants will go on the road.</p><p>In case you only turned in for the last five minutes, or want to relive the last dances, here's what happened during the final episode...</p><p><strong>Favorites Dance</strong>:</p><p><strong>Lindsey Stirling and Mark Ballas</strong>: Dancing to Wham! has never looked so good. Mark and Lindsey scored a perfect 30 to "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go," but perhaps most impressive was the rehearsal package that aired right before that detailed Lindsey's journey. Not only did she detail her struggle with anorexia, but she opened up about how the criticism from the judges on America's Got Talent propelled her to a career she never could have dreamed of. If there's a Mirrorball for that, this girl deserves it. Score: 30/30</p><p><strong>Frankie Muniz and Witney Carson</strong>: Len Goodman called Frankie and Witney's Argentine Tango fantastic, and Carrie Ann said it was a "bigger and better performance" than when they performed it the first time. I'm glad he's on the DWTS tour this winter. America needs this. Score: 30/30</p><p><strong>Jordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold</strong>: In Jordan's rehearsal package, he and his parents talked about how Jordan came in second place so many times in his career before he got his first big break with the Secret Life of the American Teenager. That's code for: Don't let second place happen on DWTS, voters. Even Lin-Manuel Miranda makes a cameo telling him to "go get 'em!" Jordan, of course, did just that, performing a flawless Samba that Carrie Ann Inaba called "much, much, much improved." (Side note to Carrie Ann: This is Jordan we are talking about. One "much improved" is one too many. The guy has always been stellar.) Score: 30/30</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauql6YvK570q2mq7Ffma6vr8innmavmam1bsDHnmSsrJGnwG6yyKeYpZ1do7aotNNmq7CnXaeypK3PZqGoqpSWu26yyKyfnqpdrLavvw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wanted-2008.html><span>←</span><span>Wanted movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2008)</span></a>
