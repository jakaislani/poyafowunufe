The pictures capture special moments in their friendship, including trips to the beach and other random outings. The&nbsp;<a href=#>Jessica Jones&nbsp;</a>star looks amazing in every <a href=#>outfit</a> pictured, with the bikini photos showing off her toned physique.</p><p>But most importantly, Krysten Ritter looks like she’s having a really good time with her friend. “Happy birthday, Ang!” the 41-year-old wrote in the caption. “You are a queen and thank heavens for you. I’m booking the next adventure immediately.” Some fans took to the comments to share well wishes too. Others just posted heart and fire emojis in response to the bikini photos.</p><p>Krysten Ritter’s acting career has been rather quiet lately. Her last film project was the 2021 dark fantasy film,&nbsp;Nightbooks. Directed by David Yarovesky from a script by Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis, the movie is based on the 2018 children’s book of the same name by J. A. White. The story follows Alex who is obsessed with scary stories.</p><p>But his love of spooky stuff takes an ugly turn when Alex is imprisoned by an evil young witch in her contemporary New York City apartment. The <a data-wpil=url href=#>Netflix</a> film stars Winslow Fegley as Alex alongside Lidya Jewett as Yasmin, a girl who was trapped by the witch years ago. Krysten Ritter stars as Natacha, the witch who kidnaps the children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/krysten-ritter-jessica-jones-scaled-e1652105471463-900x506.jpg><p>For her latest television project, Krysten Ritter will appear in&nbsp;Love and Death. Billed as a crime drama, the limited series is directed by Lesli Linka Glatter from a script by David E. Kelley. The show is based on the 1980 true story of Wylie, Texas housewife Candy Montgomery, who was accused of the brutal axe murder of her friend Betty Gore.</p><p>The series features a stellar cast led by Elizabeth Olsen as Candy Montgomery. Jesse Plemons stars as Allan Gore alongside Patrick Fugit as Pat Montgomery and Lily Rabe as Betty Gore. Keir Gilchrist appears as Ron Adams, Elizabeth Marvel as Jackie Ponder, Tom Pelphrey as Don Crowder, and Krysten Ritter as Sherry Cleckler.&nbsp;Love and Death&nbsp;is set to premiere on HBO Max later this year.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>, David E. Kelley executive produces via his David E. Kelley Productions, with Nicole Kidman and Per Saari via Blossom Films. Lesli Linka Glatter, Scott Brown, and Megan Creydt are also producing through Texas Monthly along with Matthew Tinker, Michael Klick, and Helen Verno. Lionsgate TV is the studio.</p><p>Meanwhile, Krysten Ritter recently made headlines after posting a workout video to her Instagram Stories. Captured and reposted by fans, the clip sparked rumors that the actress may be preparing to reprise her role as Jessica Jones. She also wore a t-shirt with the words “I Choose Justice” appearing around the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daredevil</a>&nbsp;logo.</p><p>Although nothing has been confirmed by <a href=#>Marvel</a>, in 2021 the actress told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Screen Rant</a>&nbsp;that she would love to play the character again. “I would just die to play Jessica again. I had the best time doing it and I just love her so much,” she told the publication.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tno5qybrfRsqqtnZ5iv6rA056pZpqVlrCpedOipbJlkp64qrrIZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-do-you-fix-a-broken-marriage.html><span>←</span><span>How do you fix a broken marriage?</span></a>
