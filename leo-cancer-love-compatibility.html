Fire and water will make a steamy physical connection and give both of them a lot of attraction. Water can indeed extinguish the fire. However, fire can also boil water and with <strong>Leo and Cancer sexuality</strong>, there is more likely going to be boiling rather than dampening.</p><p>Cancer will still need to be careful that they do not extinguish Leo’s <a href=#>natural enthusiasm</a> with their tendency to worry. Leo will need to be careful not to be too demanding of Cancer and their naturally sensitive nature.

At the same time, the lion will prefer to mix things up. They love unpredictable and original things.</p><p>In a <strong>Leo and Cancer love compatibility</strong>, both will be able to dedicate themselves emotionally in a relationship. However, they are capable of continuing to follow their instincts. They will easily <a href=#>commit themselves</a> completely to each other. Both Leo and Cancer in love will need to express their romantic intentions though.</p><p>Otherwise, they could end up riding an <a href=#>emotional roller coaster for an indeterminate amount of time</a>.

Leo tends to have expensive tastes. Cancer prefers to be more frugal. They will easily make a gorgeous and welcoming home. However, if Leo <a href=#>spends too much money</a>, Cancer is likely to worry.</p><p>With these two, the Cancer star sign will be the one manipulating emotions, even if Leo seems to be the domineering one in the relationship.
