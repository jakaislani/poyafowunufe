She is known across genres, having appeared in a number of prominent television and film releases over the years. Some of her most recognizable roles include her aforementioned role as Phoebe Halliwell in Charmed as well as her appearances in Who’s The Boss and Melrose Place. She recently re-entered the spotlight with her starring role in Netflix’s Brazen, which dropped on the streaming platform at the outset of 2022.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>In the wake of Brazen’s release, Milano is collecting hordes of new fans. She’s reached a brand new audience with the Netflix thriller, many of whom are unfamiliar with the wealth of work she put out in the ’90s and 2010s. Milano recently engaged in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>, providing her fans with a glimpse into her personal and professional life.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Alyssa Milano’s age, birthplace, and family</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1150700176.jpg><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=270 data-injectable=false>She may not look it, but Milano is pushing 50. The Brooklyn native is currently 49 and living across the country from New York, where she made her start. She now resides on a large Bell Canyon, California property, leaving plenty of space for her numerous animals.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=true>Milano and her brother Cody were raised Catholic by their parents, fashion designer Lin Milano and film score editor Thomas M. Milano. She took her first steps into the acting world at a young age, appearing in her very first role at the spritely young age of seven.</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Her biggest career steps</strong></h3><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Milano’s career has maintained at a relatively steady pace through most of her life, but some roles <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shine far brighter</a> than others. Her 1997 role in Fear, alongside fellow Hollywood heavy-hitters Reese Witherspoon and Mark Wahlberg, was widely well-received by viewers. Long before she appeared in the You-esque thriller, however, she was dazzling audiences in Commando alongside Arnold Schawarzenegger.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>In more recent years, Milano’s name resurfaced spectacularly with Netflix’s Insatiable, in which the 49-year-old actress played Coralee Armstrong. She also recently appeared in Wet Hot American Summer: 10 Years Later, a series that ranks in Milano’s top 5 television roles, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Her romantic life</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-185971434.jpg><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>Like seemingly any celebrity, Milano’s love life has had its ups and downs. She was in a relationship with The Lost Boys’ Corey Haim for three years, between 1987 and 1990, before the duo split due to Haim’s struggles with addiction.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>She was briefly engaged to Everwood actor Scott Wolf in 1993, and — for an even briefer period in 1999 — married to Remy Zero vocalist Cinjun Tate. Eventually, Milano settled down with her now-husband, David Bugliari. The duo have been married since 2009 and share two children together.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Her net worth</strong></h3><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Milano’s consistent career has netted her an enviable net worth over the years. She currently maintains a net worth of around $10 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, thanks to her gradual increase in salary over the years.</p><p data-characters=376 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true>By the time Charmed became a crowd-favorite, Milano was earning $90,000 per episode. This resulted in a paycheck of around $2 million per season and helped immensely in building the actress’ wealth. Even a 2017 financial hiccup, which saw Milano accuse her accountant of costing her millions of dollars, wasn’t enough to knock Milano out of the millionaire category.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false><strong>Fun facts</strong></h3><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Milano shared a few fun facts about herself in the Feb. 2022 interview with Us Weekly. She, like so many people, apparently has “an unhealthy obsession with houseplants” and finds “unkind people” to be her “pet peeve.”</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=false>Another moment from the interview reveals that two separate jobs qualify for the title of “worst-ever.” Her roles in Embrace of the Vampire and Poison Ivy II are apparently tied for that undesirable prize.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon56qlah6psLEq7CtoJmjtG7Azmaip6enYq6ju9StZJqkqajAonnMoqOapp9k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-mac-laptops-june-2013.html><span>←</span><span>Best Mac Laptops - June 2013</span></a>
