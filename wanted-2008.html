<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Wanted movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2008)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Never mind. Wesley leaves his office life for a hidden alternative existence in which he masters skills of fighting (by hurtling hundreds of feet) and shooting (around corners, for example). And he is introduced to Sloan (<a href=#>Morgan Freeman</a>), who, the moment I mentioned Morgan Freeman, you immediately knew was deep and wise and in charge of things. He lives in a book-lined library (but Wesley, to my intense regret, never asks him, “Have you really read all these books? Anything by Thurber?”). Sloan explains that Wesley’s father was a member of the Fraternity, killed years ago by the man Wesley is now destined to kill. This is Cross (<a href=#>Thomas Kretschmann</a>), who lurks in Europe, where Wesley also meets Pekwarsky (<a href=#>Terence Stamp</a>), another fraternity brother. (Do you suppose the Fraternity’s secret handshake is fatal? If brothers give it to each other, do they both die?)</p><p>I’d guess there are, oh, 10 or 15 shots in this entire movie without special effects. The rest of the time, we’re watching motion-capture animation, CGI, stuff done in the lab. A few of the stunts look like they could not have been faked, but who knows? What do you think your chances are when you run on top of a speeding train? For that matter, if you were assigned to kill someone in Chicago, could you figure out a better way to do it than by standing on top of an L train while it raced past your target’s office window? And how did the Fraternity know he would be visible through that window? And how ... oh, never mind.</p><p>“Wanted,” directed by a hot Russian actionmeister named <a href=#>Timur Bekmambetov</a>, is a film entire lacking in two organs I always appreciate in a movie: a heart and a mind. It is mindless, heartless, preposterous. By the end of the film, we can’t even believe the values the plot seems to believe, since the plot is deceived right along with us. The way to enjoy this film is to put your logic on hold, along with any higher sensitivities that might be vulnerable and immerse yourself as if in a video game. That “Wanted” will someday be a video game, I have not the slightest doubt. It may already be a video game, but I’m damned if I’ll look it up and find out. Objectively, I award it all honors for technical excellence. Subjectively, I’d rather be watching <a href=#>Danny Kaye</a> in the film version of “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.”</p><p>Note: I learn that “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty” will be remade next year and will star <a href=#>Mike Myers</a>. Having seen Myers’ “<a href=#>The Love Guru</a>,” I think I can predict one of Walter’s big secrets.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46wmKeslZl6c3yPcQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./guess-who-2005.html><span>←</span><span>Guess Who movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2005)</span></a>
