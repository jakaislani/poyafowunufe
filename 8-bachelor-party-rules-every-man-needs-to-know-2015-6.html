Does he want to tear up Las Vegas, or would he rather sit around with his buds and smoke cigars? Not all bachelor parties involve tons of booze and strippers. If he doesn't want strippers (perhaps because of an agreement with his fiancée), don't "surprise" him. Once the groom decides the night's festivities, it's your job to make them happen.</p><h3 class=p1>RULE #2: The groom pays for nothing.</h3><p class=p1>All costs should be split equally among those attending the party. So if you're going away for the weekend, start saving your pennies. Best man: It's your responsibility to collect the money, so start early.</p><h3 class=p1><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>All expenses should be split among the guests. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Flickr/401(k) 2013</span></span></figure></h3><h3 class=p1>RULE #3: The guest list is the groom's call.</h3><p class=p1>Some grooms want to invite family, friends, and colleagues, while others want only friends. Bottom line: It's his call. If you have a problem with someone on the guest list, remember why you both are there and avoid conflict.</p><p>Advertisement</p><h3 class=p1>RULE #4: No hazing.</h3><p class=p1>Do not embarrass the groom and certainly do not put him in danger, unless you want to explain to the bride why her soon-to-be-husband is wearing a cast.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Phil, Stu, and Alan are not your role models. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>YouTube/kareem kh90</span></span></figure><h3 class=p1>RULE #5: Don't act as if you're at a frat party.</h3><p class=p1>A few shots in honor of the groom is fine. Chasing shots by shotgunning beers? Probably not. As I said earlier, you want the groom to actually remember his last night of freedom. Drink and be merry, but if the groom ends up sunburned on a rooftop in Las Vegas, you've gone too far.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Pace yourself: Blacking out shouldn't be your goal. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Flickr/morberg</span></span></figure><h3 class=p1>RULE #6: Figure out transportation before the night (or weekend) starts.</h3><p class=p1>Best man: Put this on your growing to-do list. Plan how guests will get to and from the destination — especially when alcohol is involved. Having a member of your crew commit to being the designated driver is great, but if no one's volunteering, you need to arrange for car service. Remember: the groom pays for nothing.</p><h3 class=p1>RULE #7: The party isn't over until the groom says it's over.</h3><p class=p1>If the groom wants to stay a little longer, you stay. If he wants to leave, you leave. If he thinks you're drinking too much, you switch to water. Without the groom there would be no bachelor party, so he is in charge of everything.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonx5ecGamqGdnKS%2FbrzAq6uyZaKquaa%2FjJ6tnqqpYrqiuoynnJ6co2LBsHnKp6awZWJlfnZ5lQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./4-foods-you-should-be-buying-at-staples.html><span>←</span><span>4 Foods You Should Be Buying at Staples</span></a>
