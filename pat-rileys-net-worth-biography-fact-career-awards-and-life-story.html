Being a student at the University of Kentucky, Riley participated in both basketball and football, starting to play professionally with the San Diego Rockets and then Los Angeles Lakers. While he was a Laker, he helped the team win the NBA title in 1972, before retiring from play in 1976. He get back to the Lakers in the role of an assistant coach in 1980, and then led the team to the NBA Finals as head coach in 1983, 1984 and 1986. Again with the Lakers, he won the championship title in 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988, thus becoming the second coach ever to have scored so many wins in NBA history, right after Lenny Wilkens. It was in 1990, when Riley stepped down as coach of the Lakers, amid rumors of player mistreatment and anger problems. Regardless of these happenings, he was named NBA Coach of the Year. One year later, Riley became head coach for the New York Knicks, following a brief stint as an NBC commentator. He was named Coach of the Year once again in 1993, and coached the team to the NBA Finals the following year. In 1995, Riley left the Knicks becoming a head coach and general manager of the Miami Heat, where was named Coach of the Year for a third time. After he quit coaching for several years to dedicate on his general manager duties, he resumed his role as a coach in 2005 with an all-star team. Following a rough season with the Miami Heat, Riley officially retired in 2008, but he still remains the president of the team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fpa61edGio56xo2K7psCMsKarrJhir6q7xquYqaCpYrOir9NmmpqqlZq%2Fbq3Wmqmdq12Wu6V5y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./our-body-movie-review-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Our Body movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</span></a>
