<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Scenes from a Marriage movie review (1974)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>But he does leave, and the film’s form is a sometimes harsh, sometimes gentle, ultimately romantic (in an adult and realistic way) view of the stages of this relationship. At first, their sexual attraction for each other remains, even though they bitterly resent each other because of mutual hurts and recriminations. The frustrations they feel about themselves are taken out on each other. At one point, he beats her and weeps for himself, and we’ve never seen such despair on the screen. But the passage of time dulls the immediate hurt and the feeling of betrayal. And at last, they are able to meet as fond friends and even to make love, as if visiting an old home they’d once been cozy in.</p><p>They drift apart, they marry other people (who also remain offscreen), they meet from time to time.</p><p>Ten years after the film has opened, they find themselves in Stockholm while both their spouses are out of the country, and, as a nostalgic lark, decide to spend a weekend in their old summer cottage. But it’s haunted with memories, and they go to a cottage nearby.</p><p>In the last section of the film (subtitled “In the Middle of the Night in a Dark House”), Marianne awakens screaming with a nightmare, and Johan holds her.</p><p>And this is twenty years after they were married, and ten years after they were divorced, and they are in middle age now but in the night still fond and frightened lovers holding on for reassurance.</p><p>And that is what Bergman has been able to accept, the source of his reconciliation: Beyond love, beyond marriage, beyond the selfishness that destroys love, beyond the centrifugal force that sends egos whirling away from each other and prevents enduring relationships--beyond all these things, there still remains what we know of each other, that we care about each other, that in twenty years these people have touched and known so deeply that they still remember, and still need.</p><p>Marianne and Johan are only married for the first part of this film, but the rest of it is also scenes from their marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46smp6mlah6p77OpmSaZZ2Wv7O1wKCcZmlpbIE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./han-ji-sung-bio-age-brother-net-worth-height-pictures-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Han Ji-sung Bio: Age, Brother, Net Worth, Height, Pictures, Instagram</span></a>
