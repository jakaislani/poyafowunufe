What are the most addictive drugs? This question seems simple, but the answer depends on whom you ask.
From the points of view of different researchers, the potential for a drug to be addictive can be judged in terms of the harm it causes, the street value of the drug, the extent to which the drug activates the brain's dopamine system, how pleasurable people report the drug to be, the degree to which the drug causes withdrawal symptoms, and how easily a person trying the drug will become hooked.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>13 Minutes movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2017)</h2><time>Jul 1, 2024</time>
