Another day, another accused abuser returning to cable television. On Thursday, USA network’s Shooter aired the first episode of its third season. The drama, which features Ryan Phillippe as the titular shooter, is back in the wake of intimate partner violence allegations against its star—allegations that have seemingly been forgotten by employers and fans alike.
In September, 2017, news broke that a young model named Elsie Hewitt was suing her ex, Ryan Phillippe.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What Is Gelt? | Sporked</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

If there’s one thing I agree with Adam Sandler on, it’s that there aren’t enough Hanukkah songs. Christmas, on the other hand, has a bajillion and three (at least). There are literally so many Christmas songs that you could play a Christmas playlist for hours without any repeats.
What I’m getting at is, A.) we need more Hanukkah songs, and, B.) because there are so few, you’ve probably heard them all.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>ZOTAC Publishes Specifications of MEK Mini, MEK Ultra PCs</h2><time>Aug 20, 2024</time>

As expected, ZOTAC demonstrated its upcoming MEK Mini and MEK UItra PCs at Computex. In addition, the company published preliminary specifications of these systems. As it appears, the smaller one will be based on Intel’s six-core Coffee Lake processor, whereas the large one will be powered by Intel’s ten-core Core X CPU.
ZOTAC’s MEK Mini will be an alternative to the company’s Zbox Magnus SFF computers aimed at people who want to buy systems that work out-of-the-box rather than choosing a barebone or a system with a variable configuration.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Butternut Squash Noodle Pasta</h2><time>Aug 19, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../my-blueberry-nights-2008.html></a>
You taste "My Blueberry Nights" with your retinas. Lick up that luminous string of tart lime windows in the elevated train sliding through midnight-indigo New York. Savor the cranberry mist suffusing the atmosphere in the Memphis bar where they play Otis Redding. There are less appetizing things to look at for 90 minutes than this pretty pie-cart of a movie. Instead of chocolate-dipped strawberries, dollops of whipped cream or frosting rosebuds, its glazed slices are garnished with the faces of Norah Jones, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz and David Strathairn.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Netflix's That '90s Show is a Lackluster Throwback | TV/Streaming</h2><time>Aug 19, 2024</time>

For anyone who might recall a previous, infamous FOX show called&nbsp;“That ‘80s Show,” this one is different. It has an official connection to the original show, and the presiding grandparents to prove it. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp return as the patriarch and matriarch, respectively, of the Wisconsin home that hosts a new generation. They’re also the biggest stars of the returning cast this time, with plenty of time for Kitty’s whimsical flights of fancy and overexcitement or how the Archie Bunker-esque Red finds a new way to threaten to put his foot up someone’s ass.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Newest Films to Rent at Home | Page 1</h2><time>Aug 19, 2024</time>
