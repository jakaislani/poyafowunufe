Here’s the optimal order in which to watch Berserk.</p><h2 id=h-berserk-1997 data-injectable=false>Berserk (1997)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>The very first thing to watch in your Berserk anime experience is the original series. An adaptation from the Black Swordsman and Golden Age manga arcs, watching this will quickly get you up to speed with Guts and his time spent with the Band of the Hawk.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Given its age, this series can be quite jarring for those who aren’t fans of the older animation style. If this sounds like you then have no fear as you can opt to watch the three Berserk: Golden Age Arc movies as a supplement as they tell the same story.</p><h2 id=h-berserk-golden-age-arc-i-the-egg-of-the-king-movie data-injectable=false>Berserk: Golden Age Arc I – The Egg of the King (movie)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>If you’ve seen the original series, then you may choose to skip this trilogy of films, but if you’re looking to experience everything the Berserk anime has to offer, then it may be worth going over the events of the Golden Age arc again in glorious modern animation thanks to these three movies, starting with The Egg of the King.</p><h2 id=h-berserk-golden-age-arc-ii-the-battle-for-doldrey-movie data-injectable=false>Berserk: Golden Age Arc II – The Battle for Doldrey (movie)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=604 data-injectable=true>As the title would suggest, this sequel continues to adapt the story told in Berserk’s Golden Age manga arc, written by creator Kentaro Miura. The movie includes characters from the original manga that were cut from the 1997 series and in the film most of the first series’ story is detailed.</p><h2 id=h-berserk-golden-age-arc-iii-the-advent-movie data-injectable=false>Berserk Golden Age Arc III: The Advent (movie)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>The Advent concludes the story for watchers of the movie trilogy, giving them the perfect base to continue with Berserk’s newer additions. This is also the spot where those who watched the original series can jump in and skip out of the movies if you’re looking to shorten your overall watch time.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>This film not only rounds out the story from the original series but also offers a bridge into the newer Berserk content that would come.</p><h2 id=h-berserk-recollections-of-the-witch-ova data-injectable=false>Berserk: Recollections of the Witch (OVA)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/88b50dc28a007bbc6f699974cc723ae31496382028_main.jpg><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>Recollections of the Witch is an OVA set in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Berserk universe</a> that follows Schierke.
