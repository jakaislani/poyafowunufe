As seen in the snapshot above, the "Germany's Next Top Model" host turned up to her Halloween bash in her most unique costume to date, as a giant worm. She arrived at the event with <a href=#>her husband, Tom Kaulitz</a>, who contributed to her costume by portraying a fisherman who had just caught the bug with his long rod. Klum's costume was so spectacular that only her eyes, nose, and mouth were visible. It featured a long tail and covered her whole entire body.</p><p dir=ltr>In a hilarious interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>, Klum can be seen laying down on the floor while talking to journalists. She told the outlet the costume didn't take too long to get changed into. However, building the costume took a few months. Klum admitted she wanted to be a tree for Halloween last year but was told it would be "too difficult" to execute. As a result, she settled to be a rainworm this year.</p><p>With no surprise, fans immediately reacted to Klum's unique look on social media. "Heidi Klum out here letting everyone know he will still love you if you were a worm," one user <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "Heidi Klum dressing as a worm is my favorite thing this year," another <a href=#>person shared</a>. "Heidi Klum is a Halloween QUEEN," a third <a href=#>remarked</a>. Singer Katy Perry even <a href=#>insisted</a> Klum's worm is the "all time best costume."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhoZYB1f46hnKKcmWK4rcHMZpqopqSeu7ax0mafnqpdna6tuM6wnJ6mXaeyqrPNZq6irJhivLex0WaroZ1dqbyxecKoqq2tnZp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./urban-decay-edible-body-powder.html><span>←</span><span>Bring Back Urban Decay Edible Body Powder, My Forbidden Food</span></a>
