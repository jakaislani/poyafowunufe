Likewise,&nbsp;</span><strong>Kazi Magazine</strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;states that he embraced his dad as his role model.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“My Father, my dawg. He cared for my siblings and me while still teaching me the game. He is a real G, and I will stand on that hill forever,” Big Scarr talked about his love for his Father.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The magazine described Big Scarr as the type of artist more artists should take after, noting that he embraced his past instead of running from it.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Like his Father, he also respected his label owner and mentor, Gucci Mane. “Gucci helped keep Pooh [my cousin] and me out of some Memphis sh*t, so I appreciate him being there,” Woods said.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“Without him, none of this would’ve happened. In our communities, we, as black men, need to guide our boys into men.

However, it did not affect him; he came out victorious.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Before his death, Woods enjoyed life and had achieved considerable success and a fast-growing fan base at a young age.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Memphis star made waves worldwide with his quality and high-selling trap music. Moreover, he accepted himself for who he was.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“I’m just myself; I’m a product of the environment I’m from,” Woods said. “From the times I got shot to being reckless in my youth, my music reflects that. I hope to inspire the youth to do good.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When he was 20, he was shot in the hip. The bullet went to his spine, and he had to have his appendix removed and his right leg back into alignment.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Likewise, when Woods was 16, he met a car accident that threw him through the windshield of his friend’s car. He described the accident as the origin of his stage name, “Big Scarr.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He started rapping with his friend Baby K. His single&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Make A Play</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;got the attention of fellow rapper Gucci Mane, who later signed him to his record label.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Big Scarr exuded a rare level of openness and vulnerability, making listeners appreciate his music much more. He constantly referenced his scars and mistakes in his piece.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His music inspirations included Kodak Black, Boosie Badazz, and Rod Wave.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Explore More</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>:&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Janelle Monáe Husband: Is She Married?
