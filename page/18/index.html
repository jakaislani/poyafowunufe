Storage Devices The Xbox 360 ships with a standard dual layer DVD-ROM drive, our unit had a drive manufactured by Hitachi-LG.&nbsp; Click to Enlarge
The drive features a standard SATA interface, but like the DVD-ROM drive in the original Xbox, the 360's DVD drive also features a proprietary power connector as you can see from the picture below:

Since we're still dealing with a dual layer DVD drive, disc capacity hasn't grown since the release of the original Xbox, which may serve as a limitation for future games (potentially forcing them to multi-disc releases).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>We Are the Best! movie review (2014)</h2><time>Aug 12, 2024</time>

Eventually realizing that they need to expand if they‚Äôre to really be a band, they set their sights on Hedvig (Liv LeMoyne), a demure and comely student who‚Äôs skilled at playing acoustic guitar and singing. Though Hedvig‚Äôs a Christian, something Bobo and Klara find very non-punk, they recruit her via friendship, which she evidently needs.

<a href=../../assessing-ibms-power8-part-2-server-applications.html></a>
How serious are IBM's OpenPOWER efforts? It is a question we got a lot after publishing our reviews of the POWER8 and POWER8 servers.

And some of those Linux based systems are high-end scale up servers.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Monos movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</h2><time>Aug 11, 2024</time>
