<a href=../../jakobs-wife-movie-review-2021.html></a>
With script by Kathy Charles, Mark Steensland, and Travis Stevens (who also directed), "Jakob's Wife"&nbsp;teeters on that horror-comedy line, a line many directors find difficult to navigate. But Stevens is aware of the comedic possibilities as well as the dramatic. The film sacrifices neither. The stakes (wooden and otherwise) could not be higher. Both Fessenden and Crampton play their roles with dramatic intensity, managing to be comedic and&nbsp;poignant, while also creating three-dimensional characters.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jeannie Seely</h2><time>Jul 16, 2024</time>

<a href=../../elsa-and-fred-2014.html></a>
"Elsa & Fred" is the latest brick soufflé thrown at an unsuspecting audience. This movie is so tone-deaf that it tries to wring charm from questionable stereotypes about senior citizens and minorities. The latter is so completely out of place that it gives "Elsa & Fred" an air of elitism that I assume was not intentional. The former drives the plot, and despite the presence of the extremely charming Oscar-winning actors Christopher Plummer and Shirley MacLaine, one cannot help but root for this couple to stay the hell away from each other.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Masatoshi Nagase movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>

<a href=../../norman-2017.html></a>
With his ever-present overcoat, hat and ear buds, Norman is always walking and talking, always working it. He’s warm and friendly to everyone he meets, fancying himself as a magnanimous, well-connected power broker who’s eager to introduce people to each other for their mutual benefit. Please, just let him do this one favor for you—it would be his honor. But it’s clear that no one really knows Norman, and even though Gere is on screen for nearly the entirety of the film, we realize by the end that we don’t really know Norman, either.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What is a cripple stud in construction?</h2><time>Jul 15, 2024</time>
<a href=../../what-is-a-cripple-stud-in-construction-html.html></a>
Answer
A cripple stud is a structural member that is situated above or below a door or window. An injured rafter is one that extends from the hip to the valley of a roof or is cut short to accommodate an aperture such as a chimney or skylight, among other things. Neither cripple studs nor cripple rafters are built of a different stock than normal studs or rafters; they are simply cut to a shorter length.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/32/>← Prev Page</a>
