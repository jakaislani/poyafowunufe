Here’s the thing about Trader Joe’s: Just because the beloved grocer supposedly sells something, that doesn’t mean you’re going to find it on the shelves at your local store. There are seasonal items you’ll stumble across once every few years, and weird one-offs you’ll see on Instagram (we all follow TJ’s fan pages, right?) but never in real life.&nbsp;
When we set out to rank the best cereal at Trader Joe’s, we had to work hard to get our hands on their more elusive boxes of breakfast nosh, but then a funny thing happened: The cereals we liked the most largely ended up being among the more available items.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>James Oliver Obituary: Great loss when geneva community high school freshman swimmer james oliver pa</h2><time>Jul 3, 2024</time>

Happy St. Paddy’s day!
This one came about all because of these silly little shamrock glasses that I was determined to use this year (last year, I forgot).
Awhile back, I went through a glassware thrifting phase. I didn’t notice until I got home that these had little shamrocks on them. Bummed about why someone would put shamrocks on such otherwise-cute glasses,&nbsp;I stuck them up on a high high shelf.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../page/37/>← Prev Page</a>
