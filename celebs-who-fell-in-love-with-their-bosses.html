She has been married to Cooke Maroney, an art gallery director, since 2019, and together they share a son named Cy (born in 2022). Before Maroney, Lawrence had only a handful of big public relationships, but they were relatively significant. She dated "The Great" actor Nicholas Hoult from 2011 to 2014, with a brief split in the middle, and "Coldplay" lead singer Chris Martin from August 2014 to the following August, also with a split in there.&nbsp;</p><p>A year after that, Lawrence began dating her boss — Darren Aronofsky, who wrote and directed the film "Mother!," in which Lawrence starred. The pair began dating in September 2016, after the end of shooting, and lasted for just over a year before calling it quits.</p><p>Like many of the relationships on our list, Lawrence and Aronofsky were not only boss and worker (since directors are at the top of the film hierarchy, even when a giant celebrity is in the film, and may as well be the boss) but there also existed a substantial age difference, further complicating dynamics. Lawrence and Aronofsky are 22 years apart in age, and sources (including&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>) reported that this generational gap played a role in their relationship's demise. This is not entirely surprising, since Aronofsky's son with actor Rachel Weisz was born in 2006 and is therefore closer in age to Lawrence than he is, but it is not like massive age differences are not a dime a dozen in Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtmaYBxhI6cnKWdkqh6uLTOZp2epJxitq95y6itnmWnnsGpedOhnKKqXZe8tL%2FErGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dancing-with-the-stars-finale-night-two-recap-jordan-fisher-wins.html><span>←</span><span>'Dancing With the Stars' Finale Night Two Recap: Jordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold Take Home the Mirr</span></a>
