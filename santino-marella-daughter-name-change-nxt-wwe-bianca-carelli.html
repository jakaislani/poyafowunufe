According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cagematch.com</a>, Carelli had only worked eight matches in her career prior to signing for WWE, but that likely made her signature even more appealing to WWE higher-ups, who don't have to worry about wasting too much effort training her to unlearn habits she picked up on the indies.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The NXT Women's Tag Team Championship Is Already Pointless</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“In a couple of years, I can’t wait to go to WrestleMania just as a parent going to watch their kid," Santino said of his daughter's signing during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent chat with WWE Hall of Famers JBL and Gerald Brisco</a> on their podcast. "I don’t want to do anything, I don’t want to sign, I don’t want to talk to anybody.

In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">series of photographs</a> uploaded to WWE's website, Carelli can be seen training alongside indie performers such as Nikita Knight, Notorious Mimi, The Renegade Twins, and former Ring of Honor Women's Champion Rok-C (<a href=#>now known as Roxanne Perez</a>). The hopefuls were being coached by WWE veteran Matt Bloom, William Regal (who has since been released), and Robbie Brookside, a legend of the European independent scene.</p><p>Grace also <a href=#>attended a WWE tryout</a> in August 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmejlru1tc2oZKaZopq5ra2MnZiun5ipsrN5zZqknmWTna6vs8RmpbGsXazEpnnBopinm5FisKK%2BxKWjomc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-boxleitner.html><span>←</span><span>Learn About The Life Bruce Boxleitner's Son, Bio, Family, Net Worth and More!</span></a>
