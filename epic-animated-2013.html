<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Epic movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2013)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Before you get&nbsp; excited about "Epic," &nbsp;I should warn you that this sequence isn't representative of the film — not at all. What I've just described are the movie's end credits. They're afterthoughts, designed to keep older children amused while parents help little ones don their shoes and backpacks before tromping our for pizza. But they offer hints of what "Epic" could have been, were it not such a slave to clichés of modern American cartoon-making.</p><p>The latest from Blue Sky Studio ("<a href=#>Ice Age</a>," "Rio") is different from whatever Pixar, Disney or any other big animation outfit happens to be offering this year, but not so different that you should kick yourself for skipping it. There's a protagonist grieving over her mother's recent death, and a brilliant but scatterbrained father who loves his child but isn't the strong parental figure she desperately needs. There's a hidden world akin to Alice's Wonderland that the inquisitive heroine explores. There are beleaguered good guys that she joins in a war against bad guys that represent chaos and decay; their leader is a funny despot with a European accent. There's a mythology that will be fulfilled when good guys take a fragile pod on a journey toward a prophesied end. There's a young warrior with whom the heroine forms a flirtatious friendship. There's a tough older warrior who mentors the younger warrior. There are comic sidekicks, and a beautiful forest queen who utters platitudes about the cycles of life and then dies.</p><p>The good guys are the Leafmen, tiny forest sprites that look like humans. The bad guys are the Boggans, who look like storybook drawings of goblins or trolls. The sidekicks are two snails that worship the Leafmen and desperately want to be like them, but can't be, because they're snails. <a href=#>Josh Hutcherson</a> of "<a href=#>The Hunger Games</a>" provides the voice of the young warrior, Nod, who's physically gifted but immature; like Seyfried's Mary Katherine, he speaks with the circa-2013 colloquialisms and inflections of pretty much any teenager you'd run into at any mall anywhere in America. There's nothing special about him, or Mary Katherine, or Ronin, the older warrior voiced by <a href=#>Colin Farrell</a>, or Mandrake, the funny-vicious bad guy voiced by <a href=#>Christoph Waltz</a>, or Mug and Grub, the sidekick slugs voiced by <a href=#>Aziz Ansari</a> and <a href=#>Chris O'Dowd</a>. There's nothing special about Queen Tara, who's voiced by singer-actress <a href=#>Beyonce Knowles</a>, or about Knowles' post-credits song, which will get an Oscar nomination anyway because the original song pickings are always slim.</p><p>The compositions are attractive but not striking, the action sequences engaging but rarely thrilling. Danny Elfman's score sounds like the kind of score you'd expect an animated forest adventure to have; I can't imagine anyone claiming that he phoned it in, just as I can't imagine anyone claiming that the director <a href=#>Chris Wedge</a> ("Ice Age," "<a href=#>Robots</a>") phoned it his direction, or that the screenwriters phoned in their writing — though the fact that there are five credited writers suggests that what we see onscreen wasn't much like the first draft, or the second, or the ninth. Wedge appeared to confirm this in a 2012 interview with USA Today, in which he described the source, William Joyce's "<a href=#>The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs</a>," as "a wonderful book" but "a quaint story... We wanted to make a gigantic action-adventure movie." Fair enough. Who doesn't love a gigantic action-adventure movie, especially one that's animated?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v45%2Bp6KbXZa7qrnArZydZWJlfnQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./charlotte-lawrence.html><span>←</span><span>Charlotte Lawrence Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
