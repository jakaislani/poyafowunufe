Let’s take a look at what we know about the beautiful bald head of Robert Downey Jr.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-robert-downey-jr-s-hair data-injectable=false>What happened to Robert Downey Jr.’s hair?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Robert Downey Jr. (@robertdowneyjr)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>Don’t worry about Robert Downey Jr. because as far as we can tell, he is not going through anything serious – midlife crisis or serious illness included. His luscious locks did not just fall off his head, and we have the proof.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>He fulfilled the wish of every child by letting his own children shave his head, turning him into the bald man we see now. And, we know this because he shared a video of the event on Instagram back in October.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>But why did the actor get his children to shave his head? For a role, of course. That’s right, Robert Downey Jr. will be appearing with a bald head in an upcoming project.</p><h2 id=h-what-we-know-about-the-sympathizer-and-robert-downey-junior-s-role-in-it data-injectable=false>What we know about The Sympathizer and Robert Downey Junior’s role in it</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>The project is called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sympathizer</a>, and it is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">television mini-series that is currently in production</a>. The Sympathizer is based on a novel of the same name by Viet Thanh Nguyen, a thriller about a half-French, half-Vietnamese communist spy who is exiled to the United States. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Park Chan-wook</a> — known for Oldboy and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Decision to Leave</a> — will serve as one of the showrunners on the project which also stars Hoa Xuande, Nguyen Khan, Sandra Oh, Toan Le, Vy Le, and Alan Trong.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>The Sympathizer is a joint production between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A24</a> and HBO, and we do not know much about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Downey J</a><a href=#>r.</a>’s role in the series, other than that he shaved his head for the role, and that he will seemingly play multiple characters. He is also producing this series like he produced the reboot of Perry Mason which starred Matthew Rhys as the titular lawyer. The actor is no stranger to television series, especially ones in production for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HBO</a>.</p><p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>You have to admit, everyone was excited to see what the Marvel star had up his sleeve after his character’s death in Avengers: Endgame. That being said, seeing the actor shave his head was probably far down the list of what you were expecting. At least it’s for a very exciting reason!</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=false>While there is no exact release date for The Sympathizer, the show has wrapped up filming and is expected to be available to stream on Max in 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZektq%2BzjKilZq%2BZqbVuvs6bnKusXZm8uLrEsmSjql2oeqmtyKtkpaejqHqzsMmsZJuZnJl6qbHAnWSappRitaK10WajqKujYrK5vMuaoKedlGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./off-duty-chicago-police-officer-timothy-siwula-killed-in-tinley-park-crash-at-179th-la-grange-coroner-says.html><span>←</span><span>Off-duty Chicago Police Officer Timothy Siwula killed in Tinley Park crash at 179th, La Grange, coro</span></a>
