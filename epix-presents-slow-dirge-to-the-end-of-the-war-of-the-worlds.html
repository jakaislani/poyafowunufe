<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Epix Presents Slow Dirge to the End of the War of the Worlds | TV/Streaming</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>“War of the Worlds” starts by introducing us to a cadre of characters throughout France, including a divorced father (<a href=#>Gabriel Byrne</a>), his ex-wife (<a href=#>Elizabeth McGovern</a>), and a scientist (Lea Drucker) at an observatory who knows a thing or two about what we’ve been doing in outer space. For example, when her team picks up a bizarre signal in the premiere, she knows that the signal is the same as one we sent out looking for signs of intelligent life long ago. Has something responded? By the end of the episode, the answer to that question will be affirmative for the entire planet as metal balls crash into the earth, preceding an extinction-level event in which a signal is sent out that basically fries the human brain and destroys all forms of communication. Only a select group of people who are underground or otherwise protected—an elevator will apparently do—survive the first wave, leaving a sense that a vast majority of the population died before they even realized what was going on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/5e4429b2b8b50d5a605ee288/content_warworlds.jpg><p>Of course, the survivors largely look for safety and try to reconnect with loved ones, but the next few episodes do offer classic “TWD”-style questions. Would you stop to help someone else on your way to find out if your family was still alive? What if it meant putting what could be the only family you have left in jeopardy? The cast of unconnected characters eventually come together, sometimes literally, as a picture of survival and the questions that come with it. To be fair, this is a strong cast, including <a href=#>Natasha Little</a> as a mother now trying to keep two children alive while she looks for safety and the charismatic Bayo Gbadamosi as a refugee who ends up gravely injured.</p><p>Everyone here is up the challenge dramatically and the show looks impressive in terms of production value, but it’s all so dour and depressing. Of course, the end of the world should be intense, and there’s some credit to be given for leaning into this situation's reality, but even an action sequence that quickens the pulse or a bit of physical humor could alleviate the monotony that quickly settles bone-deep into “War of the Worlds.” A show about metal alien dogs—the version of attackers in this take really reminded me of the creature in the “Metalhead” episode of “Black Mirror” by the way—should be at least occasionally fun. The problem with monotony is it becomes impossible to care. Characters become disposable; their plight becomes superficial through the repetition. There’s a difference between something that’s intense and something that’s just brutally bleak. It almost feels like this “<a href=#>War</a>” isn’t worth winning.</p><p>Five episodes screened for review.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZp6oma16sb7ErJynrKNiwK271maboqqXmnq1u4ytn55llaOxbrvFZquhnV2srrN5zp9kraCVYsSwvsudqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./enid-raye-adams.html><span>←</span><span>Enid-Raye Adams movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
