He had been dealing with a short-term illness, but his passing was sudden and unexpected, she told the Free Press.</p><p>“I just want everyone to know how much he appreciated his fans and their support,” she said late Wednesday night, fighting back tears as she talked about her husband. They first began dating as teenagers when he was attending Brother Rice High School in Bloomfield Townships and she was enrolled next door at Marian High School.</p><p class=gnt_ar_b_p>For as long as she can remember, her husband wanted to be in radio. “He chased the dream and made it,” she said. But success didn’t stop him from being approachable to fans or becoming known as a good guy in an industry often driven by ego and self-interest.</p><p class=gnt_ar_b_p>Nicknamed “K.C., the Casual One,” Calvert brought humor, relaxed charm and a flair for interviewing music superstars to his job. When he retired in 2013 as morning host of WCSX-FM (94.7), his producer Jim O’Brien summed him up this way: “Ken’s the man. He introduced (Bob) Seger to (Bruce) Springsteen. He was there when Journey wrote ‘Don’t Stop Believin.’”</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
