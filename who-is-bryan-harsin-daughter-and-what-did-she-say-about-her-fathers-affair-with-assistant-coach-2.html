It’s not slowing us down right now from getting our players better and getting the new players that we brought in to learn what we’re doing. So who we bring in is going to enhance what we’ve already started.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-clesi-crochet></span>Who Is Clesi Crochet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Clesi Crochet is the assistant to the head coach, Bryan Harsin, and football operations at Auburn University.</p><p>Previously, she held the same position at Boise Stae Football, where Brayn used to coach.
