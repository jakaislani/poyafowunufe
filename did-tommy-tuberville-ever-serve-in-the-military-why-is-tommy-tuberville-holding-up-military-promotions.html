He was a football coach before entering politics. He first coached at Hermitage High School in Hermitage, Arkansas. He was an assistant coach at Arkansas State University.</p><p>Tommy Tuberville then went through the ranks at the University of Miami, beginning as a graduate assistant and ending as defensive coordinator in 1993, winning the national championship three times during his tenure there from 1986 to 1994. In 1994, Tuberville replaced Bob Davie as defensive coordinator under R. C. Slocum at Texas A&M University. The Aggies went 10–0–1 that season.</p><h2>Why is Tommy Tuberville holding up military promotions?</h2><p>In an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Tommy Tuberville’s comments arose during questioning from Collins about the senator’s decision to single-handedly block hundreds of promotions for high-ranking military officials in a fight against the Department of Defense’s policy allowing service members to take time off and get reimbursed for going out of state to get an abortion.</p><p>Starting in February 2023, Tuberville has held up all military promotions requiring Senate approval in protest of Defense Department policies on abortion, delaying the filling of hundreds of senior positions and leaving the Marine Corps without a leader for the first time in a century. By August 2023, the block had also left the Army and the Navy without a confirmed top officer.</p><p>Source: Ghanafuo.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51ksaqwjK2mpqWpYsG2rsSrraKknJp6psLEq2SsnaKrsm61zWaroZ1dorattdOaqbJlp53GbrXSZquopZ2uerXBwZ6pr6GcobJutM6lm6Kml2LCsXnMoqOirJGnxm680aikqKyZpLu0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./detroit-radio-legend-ken-calvert-passes-away-how-did-ken-calvert-die.html><span>←</span><span>Detroit radio legend Ken Calvert Passes Away, How Did Ken Calvert Die?</span></a>
